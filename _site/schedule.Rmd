*  Steele, C. (1997) "A Threat in the Air: How Stereotypes Shape Intellectual Identity and Performance." *American Psychologist*, vol 52 (6), pgs 613-629.  
    * The article I’ve assigned is long, alas - I chose it because it is the most complete summary of his work that I can find, and it does a great job of explaining the nuances of the argument, along with summarizing some really compelling research studies. Since the paper is long, consider the following questions, to help focus your reading (thanks to Janice Hudgings in Physics for these suggestions):

        1. What precisely is stereotype threat, and how does it differ from implicit bias, self-doubt, and explicit biases such as socioeconomic and educational discrimination, which also can affect educational success? The paper repeatedly makes the point that stereotype threat is NOT referring to the idea that negative stereotypes impair women and/or people of color’s academic performance by triggering self-doubt about their own abilities – so, what then is stereotype threat?  
        2. Beyond the two examples of stereotype threat that Dr. Steele is discussing in his paper, what are some other examples of stereotype threat?  
        3. What are the main experiments that Dr. Steele’s research group did to test their ideas about stereotype threat?
