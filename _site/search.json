You\nwill be held accountable to the standards.\nFor ideas to get started, the handout on\nThey\nSay, I Say is incredibly useful.\nMicro-essays (fewer than 500\nwords)\nYou may want to look at the\npeer review\nguidelines used to provide feedback on your written work.\n9/5/21\nConsider a time in your life that had a random / chance / fateful\naspect. Describe the scene from the experience (providing any relevant\nbackground). The title of your piece should be a single word signifying\nwhat you hope to elicit in your reader. Be as free as you like with the\ntopic and style. We will be sharing the writings with our entire ID1\nclass (they will not be posted publicly), but you will have a chance to\nrevise your essay, if you wish, before they are shared.\n9/12/21\nBelieving / Doubting game. Reading Borges with and against the grain,\nsee\nassignment. Paper is due to Sakai by Sunday midnight. As a pdf\ndocument, double spaced, put your name inside the pdf document, no title\nnecessary.\nDon’t forget about the\nThey\nSay, I Say templates that can be quite helpful in working with\nwritten sources.\n11/1/21 Post your Dear\nData postcards, to discuss in class on\n11/4/21\nFormal Essays\n(instructions and thoughts on writing a paper\n/ giving feedback to introductions)\nYou may be curious about the\ngrading\nrubric for the formal essays.\nEssay 1\nDue: 9/16/2021, 9/17/2021, 9/27/2021,\n9/30/2021, 10/8/2021Essay 1Peer Review\nfor Essay 1 before classPeer\nReview for Essay 1 in class\nThoughts on writing\nwith a lens text. Also, don’t forget about the\nThey\nSay, I Say templates that can be quite helpful in working with\nwritten sources.\nEssay 2\nDue: 10/15/2021, 10/21/2021, 11/2/2021\nEssay 2Peer Review\nfor Essay 2 before classPeer\nReview for Essay 2 in class\nEssay 3\nDue: 11/11/2021, 11/21/2021, 11/28/2021,\n12/10/2021 Essay 3Peer Review\nfor Essay 3\nhandout\non annotated bibliographies\nAdvice\non Primary and Secondary Sources by Raimo Streefkerk on Scribbr.\nYour final essay will center around a research question (that will\nbecome a thesis statement) which will be argued using sources that you\nfind. The research question will continue to evolve over the life of the\nproject, but you should keep coming back to the (evolving) idea you want\nto argue. The third essay will be a research paper describing\nhow statistics (as a discipline, as a set of data analysis tools, as\nindividual people, etc.) are/were involved in creating or reinforcing\nsystemic inequality or social injustice. In addition to a\nsuccinct and arguable thesis statement, your essay should include:\nThesis statement somewhere early on and clear to your reader.\nDetails of the event / person / tool of interest.\nHistorical context (why the thing you describe happened /\nwas able to happen).\n(Optional) You might also give the reader an idea of possible\nsolutions (how to make it better) or maybe a counter argument.\nA potential audience for your essay is a STEM undergraduate who\nfeels disempowered by the traditional canon. If your essay speaks to a\ndifferent audience, please talk to me before turning in your\nassignments.\nIdeas for\ngetting started include:\nSome of the founders of the field of statistics were eugenicists.\nFor example, you might start by reading about the journal\nNature’s reckoning with their own history supporting eugenics:\nHow\nNature contributed to science’s discriminatory legacy,\nSeptember 2022.\nOriginal medical studies were done (almost) entirely on white\nmen.\n23 & me has information primarily on white, thin, high income\nAmericans. https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/freakonomics-radio/id354668519?i=1000438218337\nContributions to the field of statistics that were by individuals\nin marginalized roles were attributed to white men.\nCorollary: because science is dominated by white men, data exist\nprimarily on their contributions. Thus, contributions by non-white men\nget overlooked. Recently (10/2/2018), Donna Strickland was awarded the\nNobel Prize in Physics. Just a few months prior (5/23/2018) Wikipedia\nrefused to allow her page to be created. As reported in The\nAtlantic, ” ‘This submission’s references do not show that the\nsubject qualifies for a Wikipedia article.’ Strickland, it was\ndetermined, had not received enough dedicated coverage elsewhere on the\ninternet to warrant a page.” https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/10/nobel-prize-physics-donna-strickland-gerard-mourou-arthur-ashkin/571909/\n[The problem here is about human influence into data and\nalgorithms.]\nThe larger issue: current algorithms and AI protocols reinforce\nexisting structures and are often biased against marginalized\ncommunities. (Summary and ideas here: https://www.infoq.com/presentations/unconscious-bias-machine-learning.)\nStatistical models were used as part of redlining.\nTuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male or\nWillowbrook Study.\nCollider bias, e.g., see “Why Statistics Don’t Capture the Full\nExtent of the Systemic Bias in Policing” by Laura Bronner, https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-statistics-dont-capture-the-full-extent-of-the-systemic-bias-in-policing/\nUsing “statistics” to show connections between race and disease\nsets up a structure of biological differences instead of focusing on\nsystemic disparities in healthcare and other socio-economic factors. See\n“Racial Health Disparities and Covid-19 – Caution and Context” in\nNew England Journal of Medicine https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2012910.\nStatistical models used to argue biological determinism (e.g.,\nsee The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould and\nrelated controversy … http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001071\nand http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/06/did_stephen_jay_gould_fudge_hi.html\n)\nIf scientific knowledge, data-based arguments, and logical &\ncritical reasoning are sound ways of discovery, why were some\nof the statistics (STEM generally) founders so prone to racist /\nmisogynist / ableist / etc. ideas? That is, what can we know\nfrom science and what can we never know from science?\nWeapons of Math Destruction (Cathy O’Neil) are 1. opaque, 2. at a\nlarge scale, 3. destructive. What WMDs are out there? Wellness programs,\nemployment tests, college applications, credit scores, insurance,\netc.\nhandout\non annotated bibliographies\nhandout on\nciting sources (Link to the solutions.)\nThe worksheet was taken directly from the Kean University Library; original\nsource.\nThank you to Vin de Silva, Gizem Karaali, Dara Regaignon, and Kara\nWittman for ideas and helpful conversations which led to the\nassignments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe Course.\nThe main idea behind this course is to get the participants (that’s\nyou) to leave in December questioning every number you come across: in\nthe media, at sporting events, when researching for another class, when\ncarrying out your own research, etc. Certainly there are some good\nnumbers out there, but I hope that you will start asking yourself\nquestions like “where did that come from?”, “what if you looked at it\nfrom another angle?”, “what if we knew the rest of the\ninformation/data?” We’ll look at sources that range from journalism to\nscholarly writing to fiction, and we’ll see how statistics are used and\nmisused. As in many ID1 courses, the goal is for you to become critical\ninquirers.\nAnonymous Feedback As someone who is constantly\nlearning and growing in many ways, I welcome your feedback about the\ncourse, the classroom dynamics, or anything else you’d like me to know.\nThere is a link to an anonymous feedback form on the landing page of our\nSakai webpage. Please provide me with feedback at any time!\nStudent Learning Outcomes.\nBy the end of the semester, students will be able to:\ndescribe the inherent and natural variability in the world around\nthem.\nargue thoughtfully that models produce information about trends and\nnot individuals.\narticulate the ways in which data are hard to collect (bias,\nopinions change, genetic info, sparse availability,…).\ncombine current and historical documents to understand some of the\nnegative impacts on society due to the statistical sciences.\nidentify ways in which graphs are effectively and ineffectively used\nto communicate.\nunderstand the writing process and know of concrete ways they can\nimprove as writers.\naccess various resources around campus to enhance their educational\npath.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nStatement.\n(adapted from Monica Linden, Brown University):\nIn an ideal world, science would be objective. However, much of\nscience is subjective and is historically built on a small subset of\nprivileged voices. In this class, we will make an effort to recognize\nhow science (and statistics!) has played a role in both understanding\ndiversity as well as in promoting systems of power and privilege. I\nacknowledge that it is possible that there may be both overt and covert\nbiases in the material due to the lens with which it was written, even\nthough the material is primarily of a scientific nature. Integrating a\ndiverse set of experiences is important for a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of science. I would like to discuss issues of diversity in\nstatistics as part of the course from time to time.\nPlease contact me if you have any suggestions to improve the quality\nof the course materials.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my\nstudents that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and\nexperiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class,\nsexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\nIf you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those\nthat appear in your official records, please let me know!\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by\nyour experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and\ntalk with me. You can also relay information to me via your mentors. I\nwant to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone\noutside of the course, the math liaisons, Dean of Students, or QSC staff\nare all excellent resources. I (like many people) am still in the\nprocess of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If\nsomething was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel\nuncomfortable, please talk to me about it. As a participant in course\ndiscussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your\nclassmates.\nDaily.\nIn class: please no\nphones or computers.\nIn class we’ll mostly be discussing the readings (which can be found\nin the course schedule.) You will each be\nresponsible for leading the class on two different occasions: once to\ncontextualize the readings and once to lead a discussion on the\nreadings. You are welcome to run the class in any of a variety of\nformats (i.e., putting students in groups to brainstorm, asking each\nstudent to respond to a question, asking provocative questions, etc.) It\nwill be very helpful for you to talk with me before your assigned day so\nthat we can devise a strategy and a set of topics/questions for your\ndiscussion. We will not discuss every word that you read, but you should\ncomplete all the readings (some of which will be used in the papers) and\nbe prepared to discuss them.\nEven if you are not assigned to lead a discussion, you will be\nexpected to participate and contribute to the discussion every day.\nClass attendance is required. Your comments in class will be evaluated\non how well they demonstrate familiarity with the reading and how they\nacknowledge and promote discussion by others. If you are one of the more\ntalkative students, try to encourage others to contribute as well. If\nyou have an idea that is somewhat off topic, write it down, and we’ll\ncome back to it. Let’s try to keep the discussions moderately linear and\non-topic.\ncontextualizing is not as easy as it looks. Remember\nthat we have all done the readings, so you don’t need to rehash the\ndetails. We would, however, appreciate your overall thoughts on the\nreadings, and, in particular, how the readings go together (or not).\nYour goal in contextualizing is to set the stage for the discussion:\nthink big (picture). You should Google at least one thing (for example,\nthe author, the NYT headlines on that day in history, etc.) to share\nwith the class. By 5pm the day before you contextualize, you should send\nan email to me and your fellow discusser describing what you’ll say in\nthe next class; your context should also be posted to the wiki by 5pm\nthe day before class. Plan to contextualize for only a few minutes (5\nmin max).\ndiscussing is probably harder than contextualizing.\nYou will be responsible for keeping the discussion going for ~45\nminutes. You should ask open ended questions (i.e., they can’t be\nanswered with “yes” or “no” or “Frank did it”). You will also be\nresponsible for sending the discussion questions via email to me and\nyour fellow contextualizer by 5pm the day before you discuss.\nAdditionally, please meet with me at least one day before you are\nleading the discussion so that we can talk about what you’ll be\ndiscussing.\nsummarizing is an important part of closing the loop\non our discussion. You are responsible for writing up one class\ndiscussion (to the Sakai wiki). Do not try to recall every word that was\nsaid in the class period, but please report on the gist of the\nconversation and the most important / interesting ideas that were\ndiscussed. The summary is due within one week of the discussion.\ndiscussion questions will be due (for every student)\nby midnight the day before the discussion. You should post at least one\nopen-ended question to the wiki on Sakai. Your question(s) should\nreflect what you got out of the readings. You might consider the big\npicture, interesting concepts, questions you had on the reading,\nreflections after having read, etc.\nWriting.\nAs you know, this course has a large writing component. The majority\nof your grade will come from the writing you do. You will write 2 formal\npapers and a research paper. Additionally, there will be assigned weekly\ninformal writings.\nformal essays will be turned in as a micro-essay,\nthen a final version, then a rewrite of the final version. Two of your\npeers, Chris, and I will give you comments on your paper; remember, our\ncomments will never be entirely comprehensive and can only be as helpful\nas your paper is good. For example, if your final version of the paper\nis difficult to read because it is full of grammatical errors, we may\ncomment mostly on those. If the rewrite fixes all of the grammatical\nerrors, the paper still may receive a “C” grade due to poor\nunderstanding of the paper topic (on which we were unable to comment for\nthe first paper because of the grammatical errors).\nPapers should be in 12-point font, have one-inch margins, and be\ndouble spaced. Include your name, the date, the course, and a title on\nevery paper. Do not include a separate title page. Instructions for how\n/ where / when to turn in papers is on the assignments page.\nresearch paper will include library research and\nprimary sources. More later.\nmicro-essays will be assigned regularly as short\n(500 words) reflections on some aspect of the readings from class. You\nshould feel free to be creative and to stretch out of your comfort zone\nwhen thinking about the readings and writing your reflections. The\ngrades for the informal writings will be given based on effort and\nparticipation.\nReading.\nThere will be a substantial amount of reading in this class (see the\nschedule). The source of the readings are:\nSakai – most of your readings will be available electronically\nvia Sakai.\nElectronic Journals – some of your readings will be available\nonline via the library’s electronic journal database. This database is\nfairly straightforward to search, but you will also get an orientation\nto this and other databases on your library orientation day.\nElectronic sources - some of the readings are hyper-linked from\nthe schedule page. If you use the sources in your\nwriting, be sure to investigate proper citation methods.\nWriting Center.\nThe Writing Center is open this semester! They open at full capacity\nafter the second week of the semester, but they will be holding limited\nhours as soon as classes begin. Writing and Speaking Partners meet\none-on-one with students to talk about their work and provide feedback\nat any stage of their preparation process. Trained to think deeply about\nrhetoric and communication across the curriculum, these student peers\nfacilitate conversations about everything from ID1 papers to senior\ntheses, lab reports to creative writing, giving presentations to\ndeveloping strategies for reading and engaging more deeply in class\ndiscussions.\nAdditionally, Jenny Thomas, the Assistant Director of College Writing\nand Language Diversity, offers specialized writing and speaking support\nfor multilingual students navigating English as an additional\nlanguage.\nTo make an appointment with a Writing or Speaking Partner, please log\non to the Portal and go to Academics > Writing Center, or contact\nthem at writing.center@pomona.edu. All appointments will be\nmade through the Portal as usual, and the meetings will be online–or\nsometimes in-person but outdoors. The Writing and Speaking Partners will\nbe flexible both about the mode of consultation (phone, Zoom, email,\nGoogle docs, walk and talk, etc.) and about their hours in order to\naccommodate student needs.\nWriting Partner\nWriting Partner: Chris Meng\nID1 has an attached Writing and Speaking Partner, Chris Meng, to help\nstudents develop their communication skills. Chris is a junior\npsychology major & math minor at Pomona. This is his first semester\nworking at the Writing Center. You will meet with him throughout the\nsemester to brainstorm ideas and revise drafts. As an attached Writing\nand Speaking Partner, Chris will know the expectations for each\nassignment and can make sure you are on track. He is a resource to help\nyou hone your writing and speaking skills and feel comfortable with\ncollege-level writing, discussion, and presentation.\nWhile there are set times when you must meet with Chris (see the\nassignments for specific dates), you are encouraged to meet with him\nwhenever you feel stuck, want to talk through an idea, or want feedback\non your writing for the course.\nClaremont\nColleges Library Research Support Services\nThe Claremont Colleges Library provides a welcoming space for\nstudents to get help on their research assignments, from theses and\ndissertations, to papers, to multimedia projects. Librarians are\navailable to work with students in any discipline at any stage of the\nresearch process, including narrowing down a topic, locating and using\nresources, or creating a formatted reference list. Even if you are an\nexperienced researcher, you can still benefit from working with a\nlibrarian: your librarian can introduce you to ideas, perspectives, or\nresources you haven’t yet considered. You will find working with a\nlibrarian to be most valuable earlier in your research process than the\nnight before your assignment is due - the earlier the better!\nGeneral\nresearch appointments or\nsubject\nspecific research appointments are available for all students at\npoint in your project. In addition, you can get support through the\nStudent Assisted Research Support, available through\nchat,\nMondays-Fridays. Check the library’s website for up-to-date hours.\nOne other library resources is their subject specific\nResearch\nGuides.\nAcademic Honesty.\nYou are on your honor to present only your work as part of your\ncourse assessments. Below, I’ve provided Pomona’s academic honesty\npolicy which is available in the Student Handbook. But before the\npolicy, I’ve given some thoughts on cheating which I have taken from\nNick Ball’s CHEM 147 Collective (thank you, Prof Ball!). Prof Ball gives\nus all something to think about when we are learning in a classroom as\nwell as on our journey to become scientists and professionals:\nThere are many known reasons why we may feel the need to “cheat” on\nproblem sets or exams:\nAn academic environment that values grades above learning.\nFinancial aid is critical for remaining in school that places undue\npressure on maintaining a high GPA.\nNavigating school, work, and/or family obligations that have\ndiverted focus from class.\nChallenges balancing coursework and mental health.\nBalancing academic, family, peer, or personal issues.\nBeing accused of cheating – whether it has occurred or not – can be\ndevastating for students. The college requires me to respond to\npotential academic dishonesty with a process that is very long and\ndamaging. As your instructor, I care about you and want to offer\nalternatives to prevent us from having to go through this process. If\nyou find yourself in a situation where “cheating” seems like the only\noption:\nPlease come talk to me. We will figure this out\ntogether.\nPomona College is an academic community, all of whose members are\nexpected to abide by ethical standards both in their conduct and in\ntheir exercise of responsibilities toward other members of the\ncommunity. The college expects students to understand and adhere to\nbasic standards of honesty and academic integrity. These standards\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\nHere are fun\nacademic\nhonesty tutorials & quizes you could work through to test your\nknowledge.\nPlease be sure to read\nPomona’s\nPolicies on Academic Integrity.\nAdditional\ninformation on citation, summarizing, and working with others so\nthat you can successfully maintain academic integrity.\nCovid Safety Awareness.\nThe faculty at Pomona College knows that person-to-person interaction\nprovides the best liberal arts education. The best learning occurs in\nsmall communities. This year we are gathering in person for what we do\nbest: create, generate, and share knowledge. During the past academic\nyear, we built community remotely, and this year we will build on the\npedagogical improvements we acquired last year. For example, we might\nmeet on zoom from time to time, or hold discussions online on Sakai\nDiscussions Board.\nOur health, both mental and physical, is paramount. We must consider\nthe health of others inside and outside the classroom. All Claremont\nColleges students have signed agreements regulating on-campus behavior\nduring the pandemic; in the classroom, we will uphold these agreements.\nWe need to take care of each other for this course to be successful. I\nask you therefore to adhere to the following principles:\nThere is a mask mandate for all indoor spaces on campus. You must\nwear a mask for the entire class; eating and drinking are not permitted.\nYour mask must cover your mouth and nose. The college has zero-tolerance\nfor violations of this policy, and our shared commitment to the health\nand safety of our community members means if you come to class unmasked\nyou will have to leave class for the day.\nClass attendance is required, but if you need to miss class for\nhealth reasons, concerning symptoms, suspected Covid exposure,\nunexpected dependent care, technology issues, or other emergency reasons\nI will work with you. Let me underscore this: please make your decisions\nalways based on health, safety, and wellness—yours and others—and I will\nwork with you at the other end. Take any potential symptoms seriously;\nwe’re counting on each other.\nWhen not in class, avoid closed public spaces, and if you can’t\navoid them: wear your mask properly, wash your hands, and maintain\nsocial distance.\nIf you, or a family member, are experiencing hardship because of\nthe pandemic, talk to me or to someone in the Dean of Students office.\nYou are not alone during this time.\nThe pandemic is fast-moving, and we might have to adjust the\nprinciples as the semester evolves. I am always happy to receive your\nfeedback to make this course work.\nLet’s care for each other, show empathy, and be supportive. While\nthere will likely be some community transmission and breakthrough\ninfections, together, we can minimize their effect on our community and\non your learning.\nGrades.\nYour final grade will be calculated as follows.\n        Formal papers              65%\n\n        Informal papers            15%\n\n        Leading discussions        10%\n\n        Class Participation        10%\n\n\n\n",

The Writing and Speaking Partners will\nbe flexible both about the mode of consultation (phone, Zoom, email,\nGoogle docs, walk and talk, etc.) and about their hours in order to\naccommodate student needs.\nSome Specific\nDetails about Turning in Papers\nReally annoying requirements that will make it easier to read many\npapers:\nIdentify your overall thesis (the core argument around which the\nentire essay is organized) and bold-face it.\nIdentify the topic sentence of each paragraph and underline\nor italicize it.\nName the file you upload to Sakai like this: Paper#.LastName.pdf, as\nin Paper2.Gallup.pdf.\nBe sure that your name, title of the paper, and date are on the\nmanuscript itself.\nDouble-spaced with 12 point type and at least 1 inch margins to\nwrite comments in.\nAny reference / citation formatting is fine, but please be\nconsistent.\nPrint a word-count at the end of your paper.\nSome General Thoughts on\nWriting1\nIntroduction\nYour task is to describe the main topic you plan to tackle in your\nformal paper. It should be specific enough to identify your paper\n(meaning that saying you intend to write about monkeys typing great\nworks of literature is too general), but of course cannot contain all\nthe arguments that your paper will contain.\nIt is common for (academic) writers to write their introductions\nlast, after they had completed the rest of the text. The reasoning\nbehind that is quite logical: one should know what is being introduced\nwell if the introduction is to be effective. You might find it useful to\nbrainstorm and jot down outlines of your entire paper, highlighting the\nspecific topics you’ll deal with, the progression of ideas, the\nconclusion, etc., all before you write the abstract.\nYou might also find it useful to consult the readings. Naturally,\nyour topic should be selected from the texts we have read so far. The\nfollowing is a list of questions you can ask yourself about the\nintroduction / ideas for the essay you are writing.\nIs the basic idea or insight a good one?\nIs it supported by logical reasoning or valid argument?\nIs it supported by evidence and examples?\nIs there a clear point of view (thesis!!)?\nDoes the idea answer the question / address the topic?\nIs the idea succinct enough for the audience and\npurpose?\nAre there mistakes in grammar, usage, spelling, or\ntyping?\nIs the tone or formality appropriate?\nFormal Paper Guidelines\nbasic structure: If you’ve never written such scholarly papers\nbefore–and I’m not assuming you have–then you might find the following\ngeneral guidelines helpful. If on the other hand you are comfortable\nwith the format, and you are confident of your ability to produce a\ncohesive, coherent paper while riffing on a theme, you can certainly\nvary the approach.\n\nintro-body-conclusion. Try dividing your paper into an introductory\nparagraph which motivates the topic, and which ends with a very clearly\nstated thesis; a body which discusses, elaborates on and elucidates the\nthesis; and a concluding paragraph which, instead of just repeating what\nwas said in the paper, continues the topic in a different-but-related\ndirection, leaving the reader intrigued and thinking.\n\n\nmain body. Your paper will probably read more clearly if you restrict\nyour ideas to one per paragraph. (It is easy for the reader to get\nthrown off if there’s a change of subject that happens from one sentence\nto the next), and if the first sentence of each paragraph gives the\nreader a good idea of what that paragraph is about, even better.\nHOWEVER, each of the ideas in the main body should build on one another\n(test: if you can rearrange your paragraphs in any order, they aren’t\nbuilding on one another).\n\n\ntone. With a formal paper, it is a good idea to avoid casual-speak,\nfirst person narratives, contractions, and other informalities.\n\nguidelines: Try to think about the essay questions in a new\nlight. That is, feel free to use/connect some of the ideas we’ve talked\nabout in class, but don’t just rehash one idea that we talked about for\nan entire hour. For example, a paper on the difference between chance\nand fate won’t be particularly interesting given how much we’ve already\ndiscussed it. Three important aspects to a paper include:\n\nthesis: your paper should have a well defined thesis that you can\nargue using material from the readings.\n\n\nsense of transition between paragraphs: one easy way to make your\npaper flow is to make ensure that paragraphs flow seamlessly into one\nanother.\n\n\nactive citation: for every claim / idea, you should be able to\nback-up your statement. Sometimes you’ll need a quote from the text\n(especially if we’re writing about literature); sometimes you’ll need a\nreference to a non-fiction source that won’t be quoted.\n\nInternet References\nThe case of internet references requires a special mention. Google\ncan be a very useful tool if you do not know, say, what a run-batted-in\nis, or what heuristics means, or what happens in the play Hamlet.\nHowever, it is difficult to distinguish between scholarly work (that has\nbeen edited and peer-reviewed, verified and error-checked) and the\nwebsite of an aficionado made up of very liberal borrowing from other\nun-cited sources. Most web references (certainly including Wikipedia)\nare not appropriate for a formal paper, and I would strongly advise\nagainst them.\nOn Rewrites\nAs a follow up to the personalized feedback you got (or will get) on\nyour formal paper, below are a few more general thoughts.\nthesis: Your thesis statement should be interesting and arguable.\nBe very careful not to simply summarize the chronology of the text. You\nshould be expressing your personal insight. If you are having trouble,\ntry reading against the grain.\nsentence level. When you are writing, and more importantly, when\nyou are reading what you’ve written, pay attention to run-on, fragmented\nsentences like this one that are awkward, contain too many ideas and\ncould be chopped up and rearranged, and also to meaningless or\nrepetitive statements like “Tversky and Kahneman discuss psychological\naspects of randomness in their paper ‘Judgment under Uncertainty:\nHeuristics and Biases.’” Also take heed of excessive verbiage lest you\ninsinuate what you do not signify–if you’re not sure what a given word\nmeans, look it up! Don’t choose big words unless there’s a good reason\nto use them. Finally, avoid using commas to suggest, pauses in the\nconversation.\nparagraph level. If you stick to one topic per paragraph, you are\nmore likely to end up with a clear paper whose ideas are easily\nunderstood by the reader. While you certainly wish to transmit complex\nideas, you do not want complicated ideas to arise because your prose\nkeeps switching trains of thought.\npaper level. Paper level problems can also be concerns of focus.\nAsk yourself what each paragraph is about, and how it relates to your\nthesis. Keep in mind that an ambitious thesis can be very specific (in\nfact, it is nearly impossible to properly address a general thesis topic\nin anything less than a book-length exposition!). The writing center can\nbe very helpful in organizing your ideas in a clear and convincing\nmanner. I also recommend a brainstorming exercise during which you write\ndown very broad-strokes ideas related to your thesis and then\nschematically connect them; ask me for more details if you’re\ninterested.\nGeneral Suggestions\nedit your paper. Try reading your paper out loud to yourself to\ncatch errors.\navoid truisms. Some statements can be at once hollow and\nimpossible to prove, disprove or even discuss. For instance, I can\nsafely discard the statement “as cultures change, so do the people in\nthose cultures” from my exposition without loss of meaning!\nbe specific at the sentence level. “Over time, the availability\nof different types of food has increased.” Reading this, I find myself\nasking about the time frame, the people who are consuming the food, the\ntypes of food, and the quantities. Sure, if I dig in a bit deeper, I\nmight divine from context. But why make your reader work for their\nmoney? Why not deliver the full impact up front?\nMaybe you mean, “During the post-war years between 1948 and 1953,\nmiddle-class American housewives saw an increase in the variety and\nquantity of processed staples like cake mixes and powdered mashed\npotatoes available in supermarkets.”\npossessive pronouns and apostrophes. “who’s” always means “who\nis.” “it’s” always means “it is.” The possessive forms of the pronouns\n“who” and “it” are “whose” and “its.” While we’re here: “whom” is used\ninstead of “who” when the pronoun is an object (of a verb or\npreposition).\nreferences. Very Important: when quoting directly from a text or\nelse summarizing an idea that you read there, you absolutely must cite\nthat reference. Technically, not citing can constitute plagiarism.\nPretty please, be careful! [Though if you are simply discussing the plot\nof the book (without a quote), and you’ve already told me which book it\nis, you don’t need to cite the action you describe.]\nalways use the present tense when writing about literature.\nThat’s because the characters will continue to perform the same acts\nthroughout time.\none topic per paragraph. If you change topics in mid-paragraph,\nyou will likely confuse your poor reader. Don’t think of “topic” in very\ngeneral terms like “statistics” or “randomness.” These are themselves\nproblematic and can create problems on the paragraph level.\ntry very hard to avoid “this/these/those” in formal writing.\nThough sometimes the “this” is clear from your text, more often than\nnot, it isn’t. And we’re back to: why make your reader work for their\nmoney? After you’ve written your paper, go back and search for “this” in\nthe paper. Every time you find one, try to replace the word to make its\nmeaning more clear.\n\nmany of the ideas below are due to\nProfessor Sarkis↩︎\n",
