As in many ID1 courses, the goal is for you to become critical inquirers.\nAnonymous Feedback As someone who is constantly learning and growing in many ways, I welcome your feedback about the course, the classroom dynamics, or anything else you’d like me to know. There is a link to an anonymous feedback form on the landing page of our Sakai webpage. Please provide me with feedback at any time!\nStudent Learning Outcomes.\nBy the end of the semester, students will be able to:\ndescribe the inherent and natural variability in the world around them.\nargue thoughtfully that models produce information about trends and not individuals.\narticulate the ways in which data are hard to collect (bias, opinions change, genetic info, sparse availability,…).\ncombine current and historical documents to understand some of the negative impacts on society due to the statistical sciences.\nidentify ways in which graphs are effectively and ineffectively used to communicate.\nunderstand the writing process and know of concrete ways they can improve as writers.\naccess various resources around campus to enhance their educational path.\nDiversity and Inclusion Statement.\n(adapted from Monica Linden, Brown University):\nIn an ideal world, science would be objective. However, much of science is subjective and is historically built on a small subset of privileged voices. In this class, we will make an effort to recognize how science (and statistics!) has played a role in both understanding diversity as well as in promoting systems of power and privilege. I acknowledge that it is possible that there may be both overt and covert biases in the material due to the lens with which it was written, even though the material is primarily of a scientific nature. Integrating a diverse set of experiences is important for a more comprehensive understanding of science. I would like to discuss issues of diversity in statistics as part of the course from time to time.\nPlease contact me if you have any suggestions to improve the quality of the course materials.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\nIf you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official records, please let me know!\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. You can also relay information to me via your mentors. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the math liaisons, Dean of Students, or QSC staff are all excellent resources. I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.\nDaily.\nIn class: please no phones or computers.\nIn class we’ll mostly be discussing the readings (which can be found in the course schedule.) You will each be responsible for leading the class on two different occasions: once to contextualize the readings and once to lead a discussion on the readings. You are welcome to run the class in any of a variety of formats (i.e., putting students in groups to brainstorm, asking each student to respond to a question, asking provocative questions, etc.) It will be very helpful for you to talk with me before your assigned day so that we can devise a strategy and a set of topics/questions for your discussion. We will not discuss every word that you read, but you should complete all the readings (some of which will be used in the papers) and be prepared to discuss them.\nEven if you are not assigned to lead a discussion, you will be expected to participate and contribute to the discussion every day. Class attendance is required. Your comments in class will be evaluated on how well they demonstrate familiarity with the reading and how they acknowledge and promote discussion by others. If you are one of the more talkative students, try to encourage others to contribute as well. If you have an idea that is somewhat off topic, write it down, and we’ll come back to it. Let’s try to keep the discussions moderately linear and on-topic.\ncontextualizing is not as easy as it looks. Remember that we have all done the readings, so you don’t need to rehash the details. We would, however, appreciate your overall thoughts on the readings, and, in particular, how the readings go together (or not). Your goal in contextualizing is to set the stage for the discussion: think big (picture). You should Google at least one thing (for example, the author, the NYT headlines on that day in history, etc.) to share with the class. By 5pm the day before you contextualize, you should send an email to me and your fellow discusser describing what you’ll say in the next class; your context should also be posted to the wiki by 5pm the day before class. Plan to contextualize for only a few minutes (5 min max).\ndiscussing is probably harder than contextualizing. You will be responsible for keeping the discussion going for ~45 minutes. You should ask open ended questions (i.e., they can’t be answered with “yes” or “no” or “Frank did it”). You will also be responsible for sending the discussion questions via email to me and your fellow contextualizer by 5pm the day before you discuss. Additionally, please meet with me at least one day before you are leading the discussion so that we can talk about what you’ll be discussing.\nsummarizing is an important part of closing the loop on our discussion. You are responsible for writing up one class discussion (to the Sakai wiki). Do not try to recall every word that was said in the class period, but please report on the gist of the conversation and the most important / interesting ideas that were discussed. The summary is due within one week of the discussion.\ndiscussion questions will be due (for every student) by midnight the day before the discussion. You should post at least one open-ended question to the wiki on Sakai. Your question(s) should reflect what you got out of the readings. You might consider the big picture, interesting concepts, questions you had on the reading, reflections after having read, etc.\nWriting.\nAs you know, this course has a large writing component. The majority of your grade will come from the writing you do. You will write 2 formal papers and a research paper. Additionally, there will be assigned weekly informal writings.\nformal essays will be turned in as a micro-essay, then a final version, then a rewrite of the final version. Two of your peers, Chris, and I will give you comments on your paper; remember, our comments will never be entirely comprehensive and can only be as helpful as your paper is good. For example, if your final version of the paper is difficult to read because it is full of grammatical errors, we may comment mostly on those. If the rewrite fixes all of the grammatical errors, the paper still may receive a “C” grade due to poor understanding of the paper topic (on which we were unable to comment for the first paper because of the grammatical errors).\nPapers should be in 12-point font, have one-inch margins, and be double spaced. Include your name, the date, the course, and a title on every paper. Do not include a separate title page. Instructions for how / where / when to turn in papers is on the assignments page.\nresearch paper will include library research and primary sources. More later.\nmicro-essays will be assigned regularly as short (500 words) reflections on some aspect of the readings from class. You should feel free to be creative and to stretch out of your comfort zone when thinking about the readings and writing your reflections. The grades for the informal writings will be given based on effort and participation.\nReading.\nThere will be a substantial amount of reading in this class (see the schedule). The source of the readings are:\nHuntley – hopefully you already know where this is (or feel free to buy the texts online).\nSakai – most of your readings will be available electronically via Sakai.\nElectronic Journals – some of your readings will be available online via the library’s electronic journal database. This database is fairly straightforward to search, but you will also get an orientation to this and other databases on your library orientation day.\nWriting Center.\nThe Writing Center is open this semester! They open at full capacity after the second week of the semester, but they will be holding limited hours as soon as classes begin. Writing and Speaking Partners meet one-on-one with students to talk about their work and provide feedback at any stage of their preparation process. Trained to think deeply about rhetoric and communication across the curriculum, these student peers facilitate conversations about everything from ID1 papers to senior theses, lab reports to creative writing, giving presentations to developing strategies for reading and engaging more deeply in class discussions.\nAdditionally, Jenny Thomas, the Assistant Director of College Writing and Language Diversity, offers specialized writing and speaking support for multilingual students navigating English as an additional language.\nTo make an appointment with a Writing or Speaking Partner, please log on to the Portal and go to Academics > Writing Center, or contact them at writing.center@pomona.edu. All appointments will be made through the Portal as usual, and the meetings will be online–or sometimes in-person but outdoors. The Writing and Speaking Partners will be flexible both about the mode of consultation (phone, Zoom, email, Google docs, walk and talk, etc.) and about their hours in order to accommodate student needs.\nWriting Partner\nWriting Partner: Chris Meng\nID1 has an attached Writing Partner, Chris Meng, to help students develop their writing skills. Chris is a senior Math major at Pomona. He has worked at the Writing Center since his sophomore year. You will meet with him throughout the semester to brainstorm ideas and revise drafts. As an attached Writing Partner, Chris will know the expectations for each assignment and can make sure you are on track. He is a resource to help you hone your writing skills and feel comfortable with college-level writing.\nWhile there are set times when you must meet with Chris (see the assignments for specific dates), you are encouraged to meet with him whenever you feel stuck, want to talk through an idea, or want feedback on your writing for the course.\nClaremont Colleges Library Research Support Services\nThe Claremont Colleges Library provides a welcoming space for students to get help on their research assignments, from theses and dissertations, to papers, to multimedia projects. Librarians are available to work with students in any discipline at any stage of the research process, including narrowing down a topic, locating and using resources, or creating a formatted reference list. Even if you are an experienced researcher, you can still benefit from working with a librarian: your librarian can introduce you to ideas, perspectives, or resources you haven’t yet considered. You will find working with a librarian to be most valuable earlier in your research process than the night before your assignment is due - the earlier the better!\nGeneral research appointments or subject specific research appointments are available for all students at point in your project. In addition, you can get support through the Student Assisted Research Support, available through chat, Mondays-Fridays. Check the library’s website for up-to-date hours.\nOne other library resources is their subject specific Research Guides.\nAcademic Honesty.\nThere is a description of Pomona’s Statement on Academic Honesty in the Student Handbook. Below I have provided the basic tenants of the policy. In ID1, we will discuss appropriate ways to cite sources. However, you are expected to abide by all the principles in the document. The basic idea is that you should never present other’s ideas as your own! Please contact me if you have any questions.\nOn independent assignments, students do not represent the ideas/language of others as theirs\nStudents do not destroy/alter the work of others\nStudents do not give/receive assistance with exams\nStudents do not represent their work done for another course as original for their current course\nStudents do not alter or fabricate data for research or laboratory projects\nHere are fun academic honesty tutorials & quizes you could work through to test your knowledge.\nPlease be sure to read Pomona’s Policies on Academic Integrity. Additional information on citation, summarizing, and working with others so that you can successfully maintain academic integrity. You will be held to all these standards from this day forward.\nGrades.\nYour final grade will be calculated as follows.\n        Formal papers              65%\n\n        Informal papers            15%\n\n        Leading discussions        10%\n\n        Class Participation        10%\n\n\n\n",
